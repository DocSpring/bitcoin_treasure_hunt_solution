# Bitcoin Treasure Hunt Solution

To celebrate the launch of our
[Bitcoin blockchain verification feature](/news/2017-11-21/bitcoin-blockchain-verification),
we gave away **0.0128&nbsp;BTC** (worth around **$100 USD** at the time of writing.)

The **Bitcoin Treasure Hunt** was a puzzle with 10 questions, including some programming challenges.
If you got all of the answers correct, the result was the private key for this Bitcoin address: [1FormAP1qhonAfJToRfYZG9QtNeMFxsurL](https://blockchain.info/address/1FormAP1qhonAfJToRfYZG9QtNeMFxsurL)

The puzzle went live on <strong>Friday, 24th November at 12:30pm PST</strong>, and the winner
[created their Bitcoin transaction](https://blockchain.info/tx/f38b10cb5d29c16f846339df1531ae1aacc27e68ef12e77f93f5fbdbd4afca86)
at **2:40pm**. The Bitcoins are no longer available, but [you can still try to solve the puzzle](https://formapi.io/blog/posts/bitcoin-treasure-hunt/)!

We've written a [blog post with all of the answers](https://formapi.io/blog/posts/bitcoin-treasure-hunt-solution/). This repo contains the code mentioned in the blog post.
